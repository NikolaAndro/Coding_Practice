# coding_practice

This repository contains coding files that are coding problems and my solutions to them.

Questions folder contains questions about programming.

1. What is Computer Vision?

- Computer Vision uses images and videos to understand a real-world scene. Just like Humans use eyes for capturing light, receptors in the brain for accessing it, and the visual cortex for processing it. Similarly, a computer understands images, videos, or a real-world scenario through machine learning algorithms and AI self-learning programming.

2. What are machine learning algorithms available in OpenCV?
An OpenCV is open for all and free cross-platform where you get a library of real-time computer vision programming functions. It is developed by Intel and is mostly written in the C++ programming language. A JavaScript version is also available as OpenCV.js which is built for web platforms.

- Some machine learning libraries available in OpenCV are:
Artificial Neural Networks, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree Learning, Convolution Neural Networks, Boosting and Gradient Boosting Trees, Expectation-Maximization algorithm, Naive Bayes classifier, K-nearest neighboring algorithm.

3. How many types of image filters in OpenCV?

-Image filters used in OpenCV are:

Bilateral Filter, Blur, Box Filter, Dilate, Build Pyramid, Erode, Filter2D, Gaussian Blur, Deriv, and Gabor Kernels, Laplacian, and Median Blur.

4. What are face recognition algorithms?

-The face recognition algorithm is basically the computer application that is used for tracking, detecting, identifying, or verifying the human faces simply from the image or the video that has been captured using the digital camera.

Some popular but evolving algorithms are:

- PCA- Principal Component Analysis
- LBPH- Local Binary Pattern Histograms
- k-NN (nearest neighbors) algorithm
- Eigenâ€™s faces
- Fisher faces
- SIFT- Scale Invariant Feature Transform
- SURF- Speed Up Robust Features
